markdown # AI Stylist Final project for the Building AI course ## Summary AI Stylist is an AI‑powered personal stylist that helps people pick clothes based on weather, body type, and personal style preferences. The goal is to make choosing outfits easier, faster, and more confident. **Building AI course project** --- ## Background Many people — including me — struggle with picking clothes for daily life, special events, and changing weather. This can waste time, create frustration, and reduce confidence. It is a common problem for people of all ages. This project aims to address: - indecision when choosing daily outfits - difficulty matching clothes into coherent outfits - uncertainty about what suits one's body type or style - choosing weather‑appropriate clothing I find this topic personally meaningful because **I often have a hard time picking clothes**, and I would love an intelligent helper that suggests stylish and practical outfits. --- ## How is it used? The AI Stylist could work as a: - **mobile app** that scans your wardrobe - **virtual closet** storing your clothes digitally - **style recommendation assistant** providing outfit suggestions - **weather‑aware tool** that adapts recommendations to temperature, rain, and season - **body‑type advisor** that considers what fits the user best **Example user flow:** 1. User opens the app in the morning 2. AI checks the weather forecast 3. AI analyzes the clothes available in the wardrobe 4. User selects the day’s activity (work, gym, date, party, etc.) 5. AI suggests 2–4 outfit combinations --- ## Data sources and AI methods **Possible data sources:** - user-uploaded wardrobe photos - public fashion datasets (e.g., DeepFashion, Fashion‑MNIST) - weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) - user preferences (color, fit, style, comfort) **AI techniques:** - **Image classification** to recognize clothing items - **Recommender systems** to generate outfit suggestions - **Similarity models** to match colors, textures, and styles - **Rule-based filtering** for weather, activity, and personal constraints - Optional: **computer vision** for analyzing body measurements or fit (only with consent) --- ## Challenges This project does **not** solve: - fully capturing someone’s unique taste - cultural variation in fashion norms - guaranteeing perfect outfit combinations - privacy risks associated with uploading photos - high‑accuracy body-shape analysis without advanced modelling **Ethical considerations:** - images of clothing must be private and secure - the model must avoid reinforcing beauty stereotypes - fairness: model should avoid gender or body‑based biases --- ## What next? Future steps could include: - 3D virtual try‑on - sustainability suggestions (second-hand options, material impact) - integration with online clothing stores - AI‑generated outfit previews - community features (share outfits, get feedback) To move forward, I would need: - larger fashion datasets - collaboration with designers and AI engineers - user testing to refine recommendations - improved outfit‑matching algorithms --- ## Acknowledgments - Inspired by fashion recommendation algorithms and virtual wardrobe apps - DeepFashion and Fashion‑MNIST datasets (if used) - Weather data providers like OpenWeatherMap - Building AI course by Reaktor & University of Helsinki  --- #

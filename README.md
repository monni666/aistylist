# StylistAi

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Ai which helps people choose clothes, it could use weather information, color theory and body type as criteria to choose outfits.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

* Choosing what to wear is hard
* Newest trends might not work for everyone


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account? It could be used at home when you have to choose what to wear for the day. Also it could help people shopping new clothes in store or in online. 



This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
I could get data about color matching from specialists in that area. 


| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

Clothes can be expensive. It is not ekological by deafault, but it could encourage to buy second hand clothing.

## What next?

I would need contract with some weather company to use the weather information. Also help with coding. 


## Acknowledgments

* Tiktok, I have seen many people doing the color test to determine which colours suit them best.
